#+title: Stuff
My emacs configuration written as a library (with some additional utils in elisp).

* Installation

** Guix
I made this [[https://github.com/KefirTheAutomator/guix-channel/blob/main/kefir/pkgs/emacs.scm#L8][package]] for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Guix][Guix]]. After installing this package eval this:
#+begin_src elisp :eval query
  (require 'stuff)
  (stuff-init)
#+end_src
I usually add it to my ~/.emacs file

** Non Guix systems
Within the source directory, eval this
#+begin_src bash
  emacs -Q --batch --load script.el
#+end_src

After that, add this to your ~/.emacs
#+begin_src elisp :eval query
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/stuff")
  (require 'stuff)
  (stuff-init)
#+end_src
